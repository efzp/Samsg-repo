Coursera task
==================================================================
Coursera task base on the information of (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset) [1]
The original information of each record is:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

It has been added dicothome variable to identify if is a test subject or not, and it has been determine the average of each subject on different activities.
